                •	<b>ADOPTION</b><br>
                There are 2,000,000 orphans and currently over 26,000,000 households in the Philippines, about 30% could afford to care for another child. Through adoption we can give these children a safe, stable, and permanent home they can finally settle in.<br><br>
                •	<b>DONATION</b><br>
                Caring for a child is not for everyone, but you can still support our cause through donations, and spreading our message.
